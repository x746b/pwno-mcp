<p align="center">stateful system for autonomous <code>pwn</code> and binary research, designed for LLMs agents.</p>

## Overview

`PwnoMCP` runs GDB + pwndbg in an isolated environment and exposes stateful debugging
and helper tooling over the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agentic coding clients.

<details>
<summary><strong>Background story</strong></summary>

*We does it came from?*: This version was a result of literation of redesigning, thinking and researching for around 6 month on this problem of "making a Pwn MCP for LLMs":

1. I first tried writing a `gdb` pluging and executing via gdb python api ([autogdb.io](https://autogdb.io)), integrating MCP backend on a single backend, authorization by rewriting bit low-level implementation of early MCP's SSE (this was around March, see [this post](https://x.com/retr0reg/status/1906206719576883670)): **Didn't work out well**, since first of capturing program stdio was a problem for `gdb` apis (we did tried delimeters but another story regarding timing we will mention later), while stopping multi-thread binary is bit problematic (makes the entire part of actual executing pretty much unusable) although this version was pretty scalable with only one command backend was enough. (autogdb was only solving the problem of connecting from you're debugging (research) machine to agent client for research), it sounds easy but it was mixed with jumping between frontend, auth and specific compatibilization problem.
2. After realizing the scability problem of [autogdb.io](https://autogdb.io), I started this idea of bring even the entire research environment on cloud with scable pre-configured environments. Tons of time learning and making mistakes in k8s specifically gke, pretty much starting learning everything fron thin air. We got a working MVP on around 2 weeks diving into this (back then I still have my AP exams). Anyway backend it's still a major problem of "how to start a environment for everyone, and how to let everyone access their own environment?" We still sticked with the original centralized MCP backend approach, but this time we assign a k8s stream channel for each users, and use these io channels on one hand to natively interact with gdb (with delimiters), *this was still intended to solve the problem of program IO capturing, it's a trick problem*, I then thought about you should also let users see their gdb session on cloud, so I came up with the approach of duplicating a stdio channel back into frontend via k8s's stream and websockets, with around 2 months of development, we got our pwno.io up-and-running, but still tons of problem that spent incredible amount of time that i didnt mentioned, from gke integration to network issues.
3. [pwno.io](https://pwno.io) was working *I can't say well, but at a working level*, there's still asynchroization problems and gke native problems but we managed to solve the most pain-in-the-ass scability, interactive IO problem that we spent around by far 3 months on. This is when I started working on pwnuous our cooperation with GGML, which will need a new thing like the previous version of pwno-mcp but for more stable support. Since for previous version, we're plugged into GDB via direct IO stream, asynchroization problem as I mentioned was another huge pain-in-the-ass, some IO slipped away and it just not stable enough for use. This is when I started thinking rewriting everything, and throw away some part just for usability for LLMs and it's full agentic compatabilization. I was working on my black hat talk back then so thought a little about statefulness, learnt about this wonderful thing that just seem to be born for us [GDB/MI (Debugging with GDB)](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/GDB_002fMI.html), I spent few days rewriting the entire thing by reading docs. I definited did spent less time conceptualizing backend architecture for pwno.io for this version of `pwno-mcp` *(around 2 days mainly on gke gateway things)*, it's definite not a very elaborate or sophisticated framework by all mean, but it did came from a shit tons of experience of trial-and-erroring my self while thinking about the question of making something that's can scale *(multi-agent, researcher using it)*, so I will say it's by far the best conceptualizations and work to best serve for the purpose of LLMs using it stabiliy and scability. And I do think it's the best time or the now-or-never time to open-source it, or this project or Pwno will die from lack of feedback loop, despite `pwno-mcp` is a little part of what we're doing.

## Features

- Stateful debugging for binaries via GDB + pwndbg, exposed over MCP for agentic coding clients
- Deterministic execution control via GDB/MI (load/run/attach, breakpoints, stepping, interrupt/poll)
- Fast context snapshots for LLMs (registers, stack, disassembly, source, backtrace) plus direct memory reads
- Exploit workflow support with an optional `pwncli` driver for interactive I/O and event polling
- Multi-session support for parallel exploitation/debugging (`session_id`-scoped workflows)
- Build + automation helpers inside the same environment (run shell commands, manage background processes, fetch repos, run Python)
- Optional RetDec integration to fetch and cache a decompilation (`BINARY_URL` env var)
- Designed for containerized usage; supports HTTP and stdio transports


## Quick Start (Docker + MCP)

Create a `./workspace` folder in your current project directory, put your target
binary there, start the server, then connect your MCP client.

1. From your current project directory, create `./workspace` and place your target binary there (you can keep its original filename):

```bash
mkdir -p ./workspace
cp ./path/to/your/binary ./workspace/chal
chmod +x ./workspace/chal
```

2. Pick transport:

- Use **HTTP** when your client asks for a `url`.
- Use **stdio** when your client asks for `command` + `args`.

3. Start server.

### HTTP mode (default transport)

```bash
docker run --rm -p 5500:5500 \
  --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
  --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  -v "$PWD/workspace:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/pwno-io/pwno-mcp:latest
```

Run this from the host shell in the directory that contains `./workspace`.

This mount makes your local `./workspace` available inside the container at `/workspace`.

MCP URL for clients in this mode:

- `http://127.0.0.1:5500/mcp`

### stdio mode (for local MCP clients)

Run this from the host shell in the directory that contains `./workspace`.

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
  --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  -v "$PWD/workspace:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/pwno-io/pwno-mcp:latest \
  --stdio
```

Notes:

- `http_path` defaults to `/mcp`.
- HTTP health endpoint is exposed at `/healthz`.
- Attach helper API defaults to `127.0.0.1:5501` inside the server runtime.
- Tool path arguments should use in-container paths under `/workspace` (or relative paths that resolve under `/workspace`).

## MCP Client Setup

All snippets below use the server name `pwno-mcp`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop (stdio)</strong></summary>

Config file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Use an absolute host path for the workspace mount (your project's `workspace` directory):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pwno-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE",
        "--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN",
        "--security-opt",
        "seccomp=unconfined",
        "--security-opt",
        "apparmor=unconfined",
        "-v",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/workspace:/workspace",
        "ghcr.io/pwno-io/pwno-mcp:latest",
        "--stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code (HTTP or stdio)</strong></summary>

Claude Code supports both remote HTTP MCP servers and local stdio MCP servers.

### Option 1 (recommended): HTTP

1. Start `pwno-mcp` in HTTP mode (see Quick Start).
2. From your project root, add the server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope project pwno-mcp http://127.0.0.1:5500/mcp
```

3. In Claude Code, run `/mcp` to verify `pwno-mcp` is connected.

### Option 2: stdio (Claude Code spawns Docker)

This stores a project-scoped `.mcp.json` and runs the server as a local process.

Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/workspace` with the absolute path to your project's `workspace` directory:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope project pwno-mcp -- \
  docker run --rm -i \
    --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
    --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
    -v "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/workspace:/workspace" \
    ghcr.io/pwno-io/pwno-mcp:latest \
    --stdio
```

Manage servers:

```bash
claude mcp list
claude mcp get pwno-mcp
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor (HTTP or stdio)</strong></summary>

Cursor MCP config locations:

- Project: `.cursor/mcp.json`
- Global: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

If you use project config, keep your binary under `PROJECT_ROOT/workspace/`.

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pwno-mcp": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5500/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Stdio example (`.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pwno-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",

## Verify Setup (Optional)

Most users can skip this section. If your MCP connection is new or you are troubleshooting,
run one quick end-to-end check with your agent.

Ask your agent:

```text
Use pwno-mcp to load /workspace/chal, set a breakpoint at main, run the program,
show full context, then step once.
```

If you followed Quick Start, the binary is `./workspace/chal` on host and
`/workspace/chal` inside tool calls.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual tool-call sequence (for troubleshooting only)</strong></summary>

```json
{"tool":"set_file","arguments":{"binary_path":"/workspace/chal"}}
{"tool":"set_breakpoint","arguments":{"location":"main"}}
{"tool":"run","arguments":{"args":""}}
{"tool":"get_context","arguments":{"context_type":"all"}}
{"tool":"step_control","arguments":{"command":"n"}}
```

Common stepping commands: `c`, `n`, `s`, `ni`, `si`.

</details>

## Tool Reference

<details>
<summary><strong>Detailed tool reference (arguments + examples)</strong></summary>

`set_file` loads an executable into GDB/pwndbg.

```json
{"tool":"set_file","arguments":{"binary_path":"/workspace/chal"}}
```

`set_breakpoint` sets a breakpoint by symbol/address/file:line, with optional condition.

```json
{"tool":"set_breakpoint","arguments":{"location":"main","condition":"$rax == 0"}}
```

`run` starts the loaded program.

```json
{"tool":"run","arguments":{"args":"arg1 arg2","start":false}}
```

`step_control` controls execution using `c`, `n`, `s`, `ni`, `si`.

```json
{"tool":"step_control","arguments":{"command":"n"}}
```

`get_context` returns debugger context. `context_type` can be `all`, `regs`, `stack`, `disasm`, `code`, `backtrace`.

```json
{"tool":"get_context","arguments":{"context_type":"all"}}
```

`get_memory` reads memory from an address.

```json
{"tool":"get_memory","arguments":{"address":"$rsp","size":64,"format":"hex"}}
```

`execute` runs raw GDB/pwndbg commands.

```json
{"tool":"execute","arguments":{"command":"info registers"}}
```

`get_session_info` returns current session + debugger state.

```json
{"tool":"get_session_info","arguments":{"session_id":"chal-a"}}
```

`create_debug_session` creates or returns an isolated debugger session for parallel workflows.

```json
{"tool":"create_debug_session","arguments":{"session_id":"chal-a"}}
```

Most debugger tools (`set_file`, `run`, `attach`, `get_context`, etc.) require explicit `session_id` selectors.

Python execution guide:

- Use `execute_python_code` for ad-hoc snippets, quick probes, and one-off analysis.
- Use `execute_python_script` only when a `.py` file already exists.
- Use `pwncli` for transient exploit-driver runs tied to a debug session.
- Create persistent `/workspace/*.py` files only when you explicitly want a reusable artifact.

`execute_python_code` runs inline Python in the managed environment without requiring a pre-existing script file.

```json
{"tool":"execute_python_code","arguments":{"code":"print('hello from inline python')","cwd":"/workspace","timeout":120.0}}
```

`execute_python_script` runs an existing script path in the managed environment.

```json
{"tool":"execute_python_script","arguments":{"script_path":"/workspace/solve.py","args":"--remote","cwd":"/workspace","timeout":300.0}}
```

`pwncli` runs an inline exploit script for a specific debug session and returns interactive startup output.

```json
{"tool":"pwncli","arguments":{"session_id":"chal-a","binary_path":"/workspace/chal","file":"from pwn import *\nprint('ready')\n"}}
```

`run_command` executes shell commands (compile/build helpers) in `/workspace` by default.

```json
{"tool":"run_command","arguments":{"command":"gcc -g vuln.c -o chal","cwd":"/workspace","timeout":30.0}}
```

`spawn_process` starts a background process.

```json
{"tool":"spawn_process","arguments":{"command":"./chal","cwd":"/workspace"}}
```

`get_process` checks spawned process status.

```json
{"tool":"get_process","arguments":{"pid":12345}}
```

`kill_process` terminates a spawned process.

```json
{"tool":"kill_process","arguments":{"pid":12345,"signal":15}}
```

`list_processes` lists tracked background processes.

```json
{"tool":"list_processes","arguments":{}}
```

</details>

## Troubleshooting

- `No binary loaded. Use set_file first.`: call `set_file` before `run`.
- `binary_path` not found: path must exist inside server runtime (Docker usually means `/workspace/...`).
- GDB attach/ptrace permission errors: keep `SYS_PTRACE`, `SYS_ADMIN`, and unconfined seccomp/apparmor flags.
- HTTP connection failures: ensure container publishes `-p 5500:5500` and client URL is exactly `http://127.0.0.1:5500/mcp` unless you changed the path.
- Liveness/readiness probes should target `http://127.0.0.1:5500/healthz`.

## Develop

This section is only for hacking on `pwno-mcp` itself.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Synchronous Tool Execution**: Unlike pwndbg-gui, each MCP tool invocation returns complete results immediately, suitable for LLM interaction.

2. **State Management**: The server maintains session state including binary info, breakpoints, watches, and command history.

3. **GDB/MI Native Commands**: Leverages GDB Machine Interface commands for structured output, as recommended in the [pygdbmi documentation](https://cs01.github.io/pygdbmi/):
    - `-file-exec-and-symbols` instead of `file` for loading binaries
    - `-break-insert` instead of `break` for structured breakpoint data
    - `-exec-run`, `-exec-continue`, `-exec-next`, etc. for execution control
    - `-data-evaluate-expression` for expression evaluation
    - `-break-list`, `-break-delete`, `-break-enable/disable` for breakpoint management
    
    This provides structured JSON-like responses instead of parsing text output, making the server more reliable and efficient.

4. **Per-Container Isolation**: Each container runs its own GDB instance, ensuring complete isolation between debugging sessions.

## Future Enhancements

- WebSocket endpoint for streaming I/O
- Advanced memory analysis tools
- Heap exploitation helpers
- ROP chain generation
- Symbolic execution integration
